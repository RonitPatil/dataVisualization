## Goals and Business Objectives

- **Identify Key Income Factors**: Analyze patterns in annual income levels above and below $50,000 to determine the key factors influencing income.
- **Develop Marketing Profiles**: Construct detailed profiles to assist UVW College in targeting potential students based on their income attributes.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Employ various data visualization techniques to uncover significant income-related attributes, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Assumptions

- **Data Accuracy and Precision**: The dataset is assumed to be free from errors and misleading information.
- **Unbiased Collection Methods**: Data collection methods are presumed unbiased, not impacted by recent economic changes.
- **Validity and Reliability**: The dataset is validated and legitimate, with reliable external data sources compatible with the initial dataset.
- **Confidentiality and Privacy**: Data confidentiality and privacy are maintained, with strict controls on data sharing.

## User Stories

### Univariate Analysis
- **Age Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of ages among different income levels using box plots to identify age-related income trends.
- **Work Class Impact**: Assess the impact of work class on income levels using pie charts to visualize income distribution across different work classes.

### Multivariate Analysis
- **Education, Occupation, and Marital Status**: Explore interactions between education, occupation, and marital status with income using stacked bar charts.
- **Race and Sex Interaction**: Analyze how race and sex relate to income levels using heatmaps.
- **Hours Worked and Age**: Examine the relationship between hours worked per week and age with income levels using faceted scatter plots.

## Visualizations
